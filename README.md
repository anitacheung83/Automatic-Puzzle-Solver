# Puzzle Solver
As part of the CSC148 course (Introduction to Computer Science), I developed a suite of Python programs focused on solving structured logic puzzles using recursive backtracking and search algorithms. This project emphasized clean object-oriented design, abstract data types, and foundational algorithmic thinking.

ðŸ§© Highlights:
**Solver Framework**: Designed a general-purpose puzzle solver that supports breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) to explore and resolve complex puzzle states efficiently.

**Sudoku Solver**: Implemented rule-based constraints and state validation to recursively solve classic Sudoku boards.

**Word Ladder Puzzle**: Developed logic to transform a start word into a goal word using valid one-letter transformations, backed by BFS for shortest path discovery.

**Expression Tree Puzzle**: Built a tree-based recursive puzzle engine that models mathematical expressions as manipulable trees.

**Modular Design**: Utilized inheritance and interfaces across a shared Puzzle base class to support polymorphism and extensibility for new puzzle types.

ðŸ§  Skills Applied:
Python (OOP, modules, recursion)

**Data Structures**: Stacks, Queues, Trees

**Algorithms**: BFS, DFS

Interface Design & Modular Architecture

This project demonstrated my ability to break down abstract problems, implement search-based algorithms, and build clean, testable code in Pythonâ€”all core skills in software development and AI fundamentals.
